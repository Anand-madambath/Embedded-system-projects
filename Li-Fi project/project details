🌿 Crop Protection Against Wild Animals Using IoT
🚀 Overview
This project aims to protect agricultural fields from wild animals using IoT technology, integrating Raspberry Pi, PIR motion sensors, Bluetooth identification, and a sound alarm system. When an animal is detected near the crops, the system identifies the species, triggers an alert, and notifies a distant user via mobile communication.
🔧 Key Features
✔️ Motion Detection using PIR sensor
✔️ Animal Identification via Bluetooth recognition
✔️ Sound Alarms to repel intruding animals
✔️ Remote Notifications to alert farmers
✔️ Scalable & Automated Monitoring
🖼️ System Architecture
Project Flow
🏗️ Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi (Main processing unit)
- PIR Motion Sensor (Animal detection)
- Bluetooth Module (Animal identification)
- Speaker or Buzzer (Sound alarm)
- Mobile Phone (Notification to user)
📝 Software & Setup
- Programming Language: Python
- Sensor Libraries: RPi.GPIO, PyBluez (for Bluetooth)
- Notification: SMS or Cloud Messaging
🔄 How It Works
- PIR sensor detects motion near the crops.
- Bluetooth module scans nearby devices (animals tagged with identifiers).
- If an animal is detected, Raspberry Pi triggers:
- A sound alarm to repel the intruder.
- A notification sent to a remote user (farmer).
- Data logging to track animal encounters.
